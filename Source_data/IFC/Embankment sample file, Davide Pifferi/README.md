# About this sample

This sample STEP file (ISO 10303-21) represents a railway embankment (including ballast and subgrade). It was provided by Davide Pifferi on April 17, 2024. Extraction was carried out using Bentley iTwin, which does not yet support IFC 4.3.  

The file was "checked" using the STEP file analyzer provided by NIST software. The Excel sheet "4x3_IFC_RIO2-sfa.xlsx" was generated by the STEP analyzer.
See *.log files in the present folder about errors and features not supported.

Another check was made using Open IFC Viewer 25.4. More errors were reported (but these are not necessarily relevant to our case, which focuses on geometry).
See 4x3_IFC_RIO2.ifc.txt log file.
