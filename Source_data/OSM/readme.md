The OSM data are centered on Sankt PÃ¶lten (Austria), in a 20km radius circle.

They are limited to the geographic layout of railway lines. The data were obtained using the overpass API from the [overpass-turbo website](https://overpass-turbo.eu/).

Two formats are available:

* in JSON, the file is the native OSM representation, consisting of nodes and ways;
* in GEOJSON, the data exported have been processed by the API, with nodes disappearing and only linestrings remaining.

For further processing, we use the GeoJSON version.

Legal reminder:

> The data included in this folder is from www.openstreetmap.org. The data is made available under ODbL.
