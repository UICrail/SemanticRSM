The OSM data are centered on Sankt PÃ¶lten (Austria), in a 20km radius circle.

They are limited to the geographic layout of railway lines. The data were obtained using the overpass API from the [overpass-turbo website](https://overpass-turbo.eu/).

Two formats are available:
* in JSON, the file is the native OSM representation, consisting of nodes and ways;
* in GEOJSON, the data exported have been processed by the API, with nodes disappearing and only linestrings remaining.
