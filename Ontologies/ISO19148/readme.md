This ontology is derived from ISO 19148:2021, originally using UML.
It is used instead of DATEX II ontologies (also derived from ISO19148) that have a much wider scope but on the other hand simplify the ISO standard.

Adhering (or not) to one of the DATEX ontologies should be considered at a later stage.
