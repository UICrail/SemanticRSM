# Ontologies folder
## Caveat
All ontologies are at draft stage and subject to change.
As of 25/4/2024: please look into the Wiki. The ontologies (TTL files) are under revision and this will require a few more days.

## Availability of the ontologies
The ontologies are provided:
* on the present GitHub repository (TBD)
* on the site http://cdm.ovh/cdm/ (TBD)
where version = 0.1 for now.

The sources should normally be synchronized, but check (most recent files are sure to be on GitHub).

The ontology files are normally available in RDF/OWL and RDF Turtle formats. They are generated by Protégé Desktop.
