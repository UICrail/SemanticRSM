# Ontologies folder
## Caveat
All ontologies are at work in progress and subject to change.
Please look into the Wiki for rationale and details.

## Availability of the ontologies
The ontologies are provided:
* on the present GitHub repository
* on the site http://cdm.ovh/cdm/rsm

The sources should be synchronized, but better check (most recent files are sure to be on GitHub).

The ontology files are normally available in RDF/OWL and RDF Turtle formats. They are generated by Protégé Desktop.

## Contents
* Infrastructure
    - topology (net elements and ports, navigabilities)
