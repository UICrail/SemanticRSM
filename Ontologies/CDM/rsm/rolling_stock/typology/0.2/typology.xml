    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A formation is rolling stock composed of vehicles or other formations (recursively), that are coupled mechanically or virtually.
Generic term from RSM, X2Rail-4, and others. Used with qualifications (fixed rake of coaches) in TSI LOCPAS 2020.
Examples of formations:
A Locomotive + a rake of coaches.
Two coupled TGV trainsets.
One ICE trainset with one coupled rescue locomotive.</rdfs:comment>
