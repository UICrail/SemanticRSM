Rolling stock "levels" are points of view in the field of rolling stock-related business (the universe of discourse).

The proposed levels are:
* operation planning level (rolling stock types in the sense of "locomotive", "wagon", "trainset", "rake of road-rail vehicles"...)
* manufacturing level (rolling stock types in the sense of en:series, fr:s√©rie, de:Baureihe; type certificates...)
* inventory level (particular vehicles with their chassis number and conformity certificate, their state of repair...)

The levels and their relationships are defined in one single ontology. References aere (or will be) made to external ontologies, e.g. defining moral or legal entities such as manufacturers, asset managers, assets, etc.
