# Current setup (from February 2025)

The diagrams are consistently produced with EDDY 3.6, which uses the Graphol visual language.

The ontologies are completely described in Graphol.

They are exported, using FTP, as RDF Turtle files to https://cdm.ovh, with local copies stored in the Ontologies folder.

# Former setup

The master set of class diagrams is SemanticRSM.vpp (a Visual Paradigm file).

Most *.png diagrams are derived from it.
