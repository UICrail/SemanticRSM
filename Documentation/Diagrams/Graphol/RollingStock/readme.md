Starting January 2025, the Rolling Stock model uses Eddy 3.6 as its main authoring tool. As a graphic environment based on the Graphol language, it is better suited to design and early development that text-based environments, but this may be a personal bias.

Protégé is still used for finalisation and testing.

Eddy, Grapholscape, and the definition of Graphol (OWL2 graphic language) are freely available on the Net.

The file named "... tweaked for Floaty" is not necessarily up-to-date. It is a modification of the original, made in order to circumvent some shortcomings of the ontology representation in Floaty. Floaty is an incomplete but easier to understand graphical ontology representation tool, part of Grapholscape (see their GitHub).
